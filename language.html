            <h2>About Tulu</h2>
            <p>
                Tulu is a Dravidian language spoken mainly in the Tulunadu region of Karnataka and northern Kerala. 
                It has a rich oral tradition and unique grammatical structure. Though not officially recognized in the 
                Indian Constitutionâ€™s Eighth Schedule, it has millions of speakers worldwide.

            <h2>Script & Literature</h2>
            <p>
                Historically, Tulu had its own script derived from the Grantha script, used primarily by priests and scholars. 
                Today, the Kannada script is used for writing Tulu, while the original script is being revived by enthusiasts.
