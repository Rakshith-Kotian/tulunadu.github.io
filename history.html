            <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>
            <p>
                Tulunaduâ€™s history dates back to over two millennia. References to the land and its people
                appear in early Sangam literature, inscriptions, and ancient trade records. Situated along 
                the Malabar Coast, Tulunadu flourished as a cultural and trade hub, connecting India with 
                Arabia, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

            <h2>The Alupa Dynasty</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most significant ruling families of Tulunadu was the <strong>Alupa Dynasty</strong>,
                which governed the region for centuries (4th century CE to 15th century CE). Their rule saw
                the development of unique temple architecture, promotion of Tulu culture, and strong maritime
                trade networks. The capital shifted between Mangalore and Barkur over different periods.

            <h2>Maritime Trade & Prosperity</h2>
            <p>
                Tulunaduâ€™s coastal position made it a thriving port region. Goods such as spices, areca nuts,
                coconuts, and rice were traded across oceans. Arab merchants left a lasting influence on the
                local culture, cuisine, and even vocabulary.

            <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>
                The people of Tulunadu developed a distinct cultural identity with unique folk traditions such
                as <em>Bhoota Kola</em>, <em>Nagamandala</em>, and <em>Kambala</em>. Temples dedicated to 
                various deities were built using indigenous architectural styles. Oral traditions kept the

            <h2>Colonial Era</h2>
            <p>
                In the 16th century, Portuguese explorers and traders arrived, followed by the Mysore rulers
                under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and eventually the British. While colonial rule introduced
                modern education and infrastructure, it also altered traditional governance and trade patterns.

            <p>
                Today, Tulunadu spans parts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and northern Kasaragod. Despite modern
                influences, it has preserved its language, rituals, and festivals. The people take pride in 
                their heritage, ensuring Tulunaduâ€™s history is celebrated and passed on to future generations.
