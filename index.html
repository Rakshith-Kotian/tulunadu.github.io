            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The roots of Tulunadu trace back over 2,000 years, with references in ancient inscriptions 
                and Sangam literature. It was a thriving hub for maritime trade, connecting India to the 
                Arab world and beyond. Rich in temple architecture and folklore, it preserves a unique 
                heritage that is distinct from neighboring regions.

        <section id="language">
            <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>
                The native tongue of Tulunadu is <strong>Tulu</strong>, a Dravidian language spoken by 
                over two million people. Tulu has its own script (Tigalari), though it is now mostly 
                written in Kannada script. Despite being a spoken language for daily life, it has a 
                rich oral tradition of songs, proverbs, and riddles.
